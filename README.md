# Subscreen
A tool to play subtitle files on your Android device. Supports all subtitle formats available on OpenSubtitles.org.

Usage:

You will need a folder named 'Subtitles' on your external storage. This should contain all subtitle files, as it is the only location where they can currently be played from. They may be selected via a listmenu upon booting the application. A basic tutorial will be created on first usage, named 'Basic Usage.srt'.

OpenSubtitles.org Support:

The (Download) option may be used to download subtitles courtesy of OpenSubtitles.org. To use it, specify a search string, and optionally a language, and click the search button. You may use the Login button to login to an OpenSubtitles account, but this is not necessary for most users.
